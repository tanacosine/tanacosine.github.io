    <h2><u>The ECG Handbook</u></h2>
    <p>The ECG Handbook was something that I procured during my general clerkship as part of my set of notes before the (then) mid-block Data Interpretation assessment. I used some experience from my time back then working as a collaborator within the Faculty ECG Handbook to help me better procure this piece. The handbook features typical findings of different types of cardiac conditions, with a special emphasis on the presentation of arrhythmias and their pathomechanisms. Definitely helped me pass the mid-block without a hitch, and has been distributed to others before being superceded by my pocket guide.</p>

    <h2><u>[Incomplete] ECG Pocket Guide</u></h2>
    <p>This was made after my personal ECG Handbook following feedback from my peers. The most commonly heard concern was that there were not enough annotated ECG strips, and descriptions bunched up within the ECG Handbook did little to help students pinpoint their corresponding findings on the strips themselves. The feedback from the ECG handbook were incorporated into this pocket guide, which focuses on helping readers visualise the specific waves that the descriptive terms are pointing to. Given the heavy annotations that are often required, as well as my current workload as an Assistant Intern, this project remains <u><b>incomplete.</b></u> However, I will try to make time to work on this during brief reprieves from studying, and will upload a completed version as soon as it is available.</p>

    <h2><u>Anki Card Table Generator</u></h2>
    <p>This started from a point of frustration for me, since I was someone who learned better from creating tables on topics, being unable to craft them in Anki inspired me to make something based on my limited knowledge on Google Sheets, HTML, and CSS that helped you generate them.</p>

    <h2><u>HKUMed ECG Handbook</u></h2>
    <p>This was my first taste of collaborative work within HKUMed. In this official ECG handbook, I was tasked with procuring the chapter on Atrioventricular Block, which somehow ended up on the Summative Exam for the M29 MBBS I cohort. I apologise.<br>Anyhow, this definitely planted a seed for my passion for ECG and Medical Education. It also includes foundational materials for understanding STEMIs, NSTEMIs, as well as different Arrhythmias.</p>

    <h2><u>Preclinical Cardiac Cycle & ECG NPT</u></h2>
    <p>This was my first experience in conducting an NPT session within the medical faculty, so the quality might be a little shoddy compared to other teaching sessions by other tutors. During the session, I covered the basics of the cardiac cycle, basic skills in ECG interpretation that are expected of a student in MBBS I, as well as important components in the neural controal of the Heart Rate. As an aside, I don't really know why this section was isolated from others that focused on blood pressure and cardiac output, but oh well, you can only do what you can in these circumstances.</p>
